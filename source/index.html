                    <h3>Shot Schedule</h3>
                    <p>Do you know which shots your children will receive at their next appointment, which shots are overdue, which shots they've completed already?</p>
                    <p>Our schedule feed will make the status of your children's shots clear the moment you open the app. There's no need to worry about missing shots and if you do, you'll know which ones to catch up.</p>
                    <p>It's completely flexible, so if you need to have a shot outside of the CDC's recommended schedule or you don't want your children to receive a certain vaccine, it will help you keep track.</p>

                    <p>Our reminders feature plugs directly into our appointment tool. Simply schedule an appointment for which ever shots your children need and we'll make sure you remember it.</p>
                    <p>Reminders link up with your Google calendar, so you can see when they're on and you won't accidentally schedule anything over the top of them.</p>
