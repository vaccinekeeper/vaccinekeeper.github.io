    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It only took a year but Vaccine Keeper <em>kids</em> is finally ready to take on users!</p>

<p>Right now, Vaccine Keeper <em>kids</em> is a web app but it will format itself to mobile phones or tables.
This enables us to quickly implement changes from user feedback to make the app as effective and user friendly as possible.</p>

<p>Gradually once you are happy with the app we will port Vaccine Keeper <em>kids</em> onto iOS and Android platforms.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="www.vaccinekeeper.com/signup">sign up</a> and you will receive an email with your login details.
I suggest that you sign up with a Google email and login by pressing the Google login button
so that Vaccine Keeper can set reminders on your Google calendar.</p>
