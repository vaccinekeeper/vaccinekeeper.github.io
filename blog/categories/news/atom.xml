This enables us to quickly implement changes from user feedback to make the app as effective and user friendly as possible.</p>

<p>Gradually once you are happy with the app we will port Vaccine Keeper <em>kids</em> onto iOS and Android platforms.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="www.vaccinekeeper.com/signup">sign up</a> and you will receive an email with your login details.
I suggest that you sign up with a Google email and login by pressing the Google login button
