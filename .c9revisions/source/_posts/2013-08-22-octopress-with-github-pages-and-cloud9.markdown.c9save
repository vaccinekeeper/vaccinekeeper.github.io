I've also set it up on [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), a\nsweet web app IDE that enables me to write blog posts on any device.\n\nHaving done a bit of research, when it comes down to blogging solutions, you've either got php based CMS's\nsuch as [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) or static site generators like Jekyll. I've used Wordpress before\nbut it's functionality has always irritated me, it's too bloated for what I need and I couldn't be bothered \ndealing with a database.\n\nJekyll has all the functionality I need from a blog but doesn't have a database, which is great as it \nmeans I can host it out of static location such as GitHub Pages or [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). \nNot only are these services free, at least for now, but they should be more robust than your random \nshared web hosting provider.\n\nJekyll by itself is bare bones, you need to create your own directory structure, templates etc, so to make my life\neasier I turned to Octopress, and establish framework that takes care of all the pain and has many nice\npublicly available themes to hack.\n\nThe only thing missing with Octopress / Jekyll is it doesn't have a web interface, so that's why I plugged it into Cloud9. \n\nGetting it all running was non trivial so I figure this could be a useful blog post for those that are into this kind of thing!\n\n\n0. Open a GitHub account and set up a public SSH key that you can use with Cloud9\n\nOut of scope for this blog but there are plenty of instructions floating around on the web. \nincluding those straight from the horses mouth https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys\n\n1. Create a repository for the GitHub Pages hosted website\n\nDecide on organization or project page\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages\n\nI went with an organization page, so if you want to set that up on your GitHub account go here:\nNew organization: https://github.com/account/organizations/new\nname: vaccinekeeper\n\nCreate a repository. The naming convention is important, it must be organization.github.io... I've seen .com work too\nvaccinekeeper.github.io for pages at: http://vaccinekeeper.github.io/\nDo not create a README or put anything in the repository for now\n\n2. Open a Cloud9 account and create a workspace with Octopress on it\n\nGo to c9.io and login with your github account\n\"Create new workspace\"\n\"clone from URL\" git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git\n\n3. Set up Octopress inside Cloud9\n\nClick on your octopress project and hit the start editing button\nGo to the terminal\nCheck the ruby version is 1.9.3\nruby --version\n\ninstall the bundler dependency manager\ngem install bundler\n\ninstall dependencies specified in gemfile\nbundle install\n\nOctopress builds a Rakefile for you with all your tasks, to run a task, use the rake command\nInstall the default theme\nrake install\n\n4. At this stage you can generate your blog and view a preview or you can skip this step and get it ready for GitHub Pages\n\nUnlike Wordpress, which actively pulls your posts out of a database, Jekyll parses your source files then uses that information\nto generate a static version of your website. Every time you make a change to the source, that is write a new page or blog post\nyou need to generate a new blog. More here http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html\n\nRun the Octopress blog generator\nrake generate\n\nIf you run the preview now you will get a \"Error: you may be using the wrong PORT & HOST for your server app\"\n\nTo fix that, edit the Rakefile like so http://www.devopsy.com/blog/2012/10/04/octopress-on-cloud9/\n#server_port     = \"4000\"      # port for preview server eg. localhost:4000\nserver_host     = ENV['IP'] ||= '0.0.0.0'     # server bind address for preview server\nserver_port     = ENV['PORT'] ||= \"4000\"      # port for preview server eg. localhost:4000\n#rackupPid = Process.spawn(\"rackup --port #{server_port}\")\nrackupPid = Process.spawn(\"rackup --host #{server_host} --port #{server_port}\")\n\nView preview at http://vaccinekeeper_website.michaeljaniak.c9.io/  workspace.accountname.c9.io\nrake preview\nCtrl C to cancel\n\n5. Get your blog ready for GitHub pages\n\nOctopress gives you a single command for setting up on GitHub pages that does lots of useful things, read more here\nhttp://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/\nrake setup_github_pages\n\nYou will need to enter your repository url\ngit@github.com:vaccinekeeper/vaccinekeeper.github.io.git\n\nYour source is now on your \"source\" branch, while your blog is on the \"master\" branch\n \n6. Deploy and commit everything to github\n\nGenerate your blog content (if you skipped step 4)\nrake generate\n\nDeploy the master branch, that is the static assets for your blog onto GitHub using Octopress' deploy command\nrake deploy\n \nCommit the source to GitHub\n\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'source commit'\ngit push origin source\n\nNow if you go to your repository at github.com/organization/organization.github.io you will notice that\nyou have two branches, a master branch and a source and if you go to http://organization.github.io/\nyou have your blog!\n\n7. Start blogging http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/\n\nrake new_post[\"title\"]\nrake generate\n\nthen preview or deploy\nrake preview\nrake deploy\n\nAnd remember to commit the source\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'source commit'\ngit push origin source\n"]],"start1":108,"start2":108,"length1":12,"length2":5473}]],"length":5581,"saved":false}
